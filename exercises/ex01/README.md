Hello!

All homework in this exercise was completed by me (Samantha Young) and not Nina.
Nina's homework is submitted under her fork of the exercise. 

My laptop has been in IT so I (Samantha Young) completed this homework assignment (Exercise 1) on Nina's old Olin laptop.
She uses her Mac for all assignments now so she is letting me borrow her old Olin laptop.
I should have my linux partition set up for the next homework assignment so this should not be a problem again.
I had not realized that all of my commits for this homework were under Nina's git account because her git is tied to her laptop.


Thank you for understanding and I apologize for the inconvenience.
Samantha Young
